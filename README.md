# ListMaker
Android app allowing users to create a list of items (tasks, things to read, projects, etc.) Clicking on an item in the main list will display a sub-list where a user can define sub-tasks or action items related to the parent list item. Long clicking an item will remove that item from a list. A simple and straightforward way of organizing your TODO items.
