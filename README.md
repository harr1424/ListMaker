This project has two branches. The branch 'MIDTERM_not_persistent' implements a list making application using the skills covered 
in the first half of the Android Developer's Training Course 'Android Basics in Kotlin.' The main branch contains the same application, 
but application data is stored persistently by making use of the Room library.
