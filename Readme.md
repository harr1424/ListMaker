# ListMaker
Android app demonstrating the use of a ViewModel to store LiveData displayed using a RecyclerView

This project has two branches. The branch 'MIDTERM_not_persistent' implements a list making application using the skills covered
in the first half of the Android Developer's Training Course 'Android Basics in Kotlin.' The branch FINAL contains the same application,
but application data is stored persistently using the Room library.
